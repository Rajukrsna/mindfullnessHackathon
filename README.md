# Serenity - A Mindfulness Application 🧘‍♀️🧘‍♂️

Serenity is an intelligent mindfulness application that helps users detect their emotions through voice, image, and webcam inputs. Based on these emotional states, it recommends personalized meditation practices to improve mood or provide relief. The app also tracks your daily progress in meditation practices to promote emotional well-being.

## 🌟 Inspiration  
Mental well-being is a universal need, yet stress, anxiety, and emotional imbalance often go unnoticed. We wanted to create a solution that blends technology with mindfulness to provide personalized and AI-guided meditation practices. Our inspiration comes from the desire to empower individuals to lead healthier, more balanced lives. 🌈
